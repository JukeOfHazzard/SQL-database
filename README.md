# SQL-database
Writing code to work with SQL databases
insert, modify, delete, and retrieve (or query) data
# Overview

This was my attempt to learn how to use the different functionalities of the SQLite commands and executes to
get the most out of the data and understand some of the concepts between the more complicated commands.

This program puts the information of the Sql Commands into a python class. And all the user has to do is
tell the class to access the functions that uses those commands.

The purpose of this software is compare and look at multiple sources of spells from DND and see what they have
available for the players. This could be later used for data analysis or for checking for plagerism of spells.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

I am using just a regular database file in order to use the SQLite queries on.

The tables are just a singluar table full of many rows and columns. There are a lot of data in the table
so going through it is a bit of a hassle for my first time learning how to work with databases.

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.8 32-bit
* Git / GitHub 
* Pandas (an imported library)
* SQLite library, used to actually worke with the database

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Finish the Add collumn function.
* Be able to make and take tables from the internet to work with.
* Have the main fuction do more things than just run the program.
